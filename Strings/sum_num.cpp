/*
Q) Given a string containing alphanumeric characters, 
calculate sum of all numbers present in the string

Input:  1abc23
Output: 24

Input:  123abc
Output: 123

NOTE : The only tricky part in this question is that multiple 
consecutive digits are considered as one number.
The idea is very simple. We scan each character of the input 
string and if a number is formed by consecutive characters of 
the string, we increment the result by that amount.
