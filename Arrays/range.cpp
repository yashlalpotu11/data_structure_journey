/*
Q)Given N numbers and Q queries, each query consists of L and R. 
Task is to write a program which prints the count of numbers which 
divides all numbers in the given range L-R.

Input : a = {3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 6} 
        Q = 2
        L = 1 R = 4  
        L = 2 R = 6
    
Output :  0
          2

Explanation : The range 1-4 has {3, 4, 2, 2} 
which does not have any number that divides all the 
numbers in this range. 
The range 2-6 has {4, 2, 2, 4, 6} which has  2 numbers {2, 2} which divides 
all numbers in the given range.
